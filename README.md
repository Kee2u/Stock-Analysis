# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve is a recent finance graduate whose parents have invested in DAQO energy stock. The goal of this project was to see how well the stock compared to other clean energy stocks. 

I analyzed the stocks based on their past perfomance during 2017 and 2018. These were the metrics I used to measure performance:
    1. How actively were they traded in the past?
    2. What were their yearly returns? (percentage change in price over 1 year.)

## Results
### 2017 performance
